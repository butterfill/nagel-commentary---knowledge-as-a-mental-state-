\footnote{
According to Nagel,
`According to the view currently standard in philosophy,
in attributing knowledge of a proposition ... we attribute the mental state of belief' (p.\ 11).
}







Nagel seems to rely on facts about what knowledge being very closely bound up with facts about how human adults ordinarily 
think about it.
At one point she writes:
%
\begin{quote}
`According to the view that is currently standard in philosophy,
in attributing knowledge [...]
we attribute the mental state of belief'
(p.\ 11)
\end{quote}
%
There are two different ways of interpreting this claim.
On one interpretation, it is a claim about what mindreading involves.







Nagel suggests that
defending the claim about recognition is useful, or perhaps even necessary,
for defending the 

links 
the claim 
about belief recognition depending on knowledge recognition
to the claim that 
knowledge is a mental state in its own right
(rather than being reducible to belief, truth and other ingredients).




In what follows I 
argue, contra  Nagel, that
the currently available evidence fails on balance to support either view.
This will require considering a broader range of findings than Nagel discusses.
Before doing this, 
I first 

I also offer an alternative view,


\section{Introduction}
Nagel links 
the claim that knowledge is a mental state in its own right
(rather than being reducible to belief, truth and other ingredients)
with the claim that
`the capacity to recognize belief depends on some prior mastery of the concept of knowledge' (p.\ 14).
In what follows I shall object
both to the link
and to Nagel's argument for the second claim.


Nagel connects questions about 
what knowledge is
with research on 
infants', adults' and nonhumans' abilities to track knowledge and ignorance.



 
 

\section{Distinctions}

The answer may depend on what is involved in having a capacity  to recognize belief and a prior mastery of the concept of knowledge.%
\footnote{
Nagel also puts what I take to be the same thesis by saying that `an ability to track what others would know seems to be the precondition, rather than the product, of an ability to track what they would believe' (p.\ 3).
It may be important to distinguish mastery of a concept of knowledge from abilities to track what others know.
}
So before addressing this question directly it will be helpful to have some distinctions in place.
The first distinction is between theory of mind abilities and theory of mind cognition.
A theory of mind \textit{ability} is an ability that exists in part because exercising it brings benefits obtaining which depends on exploiting or influencing facts about othersâ€™ perception, knowledge, belief, desire or any other psychological states.  
Theory of mind \textit{cognition}  involves representing psychological states.
This distinction matters because not all theory of mind abilities involve theory of mind cognition.
To illustrate, some animals are able to modify their behaviour  in the presence of eyes directed at them \citep[e.g.][]{ernest-jones_effects_2011}.
It is plausible that this ability exists in part because it enables individuals to influence what others perceive.
But it doesn't follow, of course, that exercising this ability involves representing others' perceptions; for all we have said, the ability might depend on representing eyes and not perceptions.  



I shall interpret talk about \textit{tracking} mental states in terms of theory of mind abilities.
To track what another knows is to exercise theory of mind abilities concerning knowledge; this may but need not involve representing the other's knowledge.
By contrast, I suppose that \textit{recognising} and \textit{ascribing} knowledge does involve representing knowledge states.




Nagel's core claim concerns theory of mind cognition, not only theory of mind abilities. 
The issue concerns representations of knowledge and belief, not merely abilities to track them.%




Talk about tracking mental states is a natural

\section{***}
Arguments for the claim that knowledge is a mental state have been rejected by philosophers on several quite different grounds.

What do human adults understand of knowledge?
Consider two claims about the nature of knowledge.



Nagel argues that they treat knowledge as explanatory of action, that they treat it as a state (rather than, say, as an ability), and that they treat it as a mental state (rather than, say, as a bodily state).
 

Is `the identification of knowledge as a mental state ...\ one of the central principles of our [human adults'] intuitive mindreading system?'




\section{Tracking vs.\ Representing}




In footnote 25 Nagel writes:
%
\begin{quote}
`By observing that chimpanzees have some capacity to recognize the state of knowledge, one need not thereby credit chimpanzees with any very sophisticated understanding of the nature of knowledge'
\end{quote}
%
I want to distinguish two issues.
One is whether
