According to Nagel,

Nagel seems to rely on facts about what knowledge being very closely bound up with facts about how human adults ordinarily 
think about it.
At one point she writes:
%
\begin{quote}
`According to the view that is currently standard in philosophy,
in attributing knowledge [...]
we attribute the mental state of belief'
(p.\ 11)
\end{quote}
%
There are two different ways of interpreting this claim.
On one interpretation, it is a claim about what mindreading involves.







Nagel suggests that
defending the claim about recognition is useful, or perhaps even necessary,
for defending the 

links 
the claim 
about belief recognition depending on knowledge recognition
to the claim that 
knowledge is a mental state in its own right
(rather than being reducible to belief, truth and other ingredients).




In what follows I 
argue, contra  Nagel, that
the currently available evidence fails on balance to support either view.
This will require considering a broader range of findings than Nagel discusses.
Before doing this, 
I first 

I also offer an alternative view,


\section{Introduction}
Nagel links 
the claim that knowledge is a mental state in its own right
(rather than being reducible to belief, truth and other ingredients)
with the claim that
`the capacity to recognize belief depends on some prior mastery of the concept of knowledge' (p.\ 14).
In what follows I shall object
both to the link
and to Nagel's argument for the second claim.


Nagel connects questions about 
what knowledge is
with research on 
infants', adults' and nonhumans' abilities to track knowledge and ignorance.
