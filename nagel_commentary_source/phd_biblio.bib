	Abstract = {Selective neurological impairments can shed light on different aspects of motor cognition. Brain-damaged patients with anosognosia for hemiplegia deny their motor deficit and believe they can still move the paralysed limb. Here we study, for the first time, if the anomalous subjective experience that their affected hand can still move, may have objective consequences that constrain movement execution with the opposite, intact hand. Using a bimanual motor task, in which anosognosic patients were asked to simultaneously trace out lines with their unaffected hand and circles with their paralysed hand, we found that the trajectories of the intact hand were influenced by the requested movement of the paralysed hand, with the intact hand tending to assume an oval trajectory (bimanual coupling effect). This effect was comparable to that of a group of healthy subjects who actually moved both hands. By contrast, brain-damaged patients with motor neglect or actual hemiplegia but no anosognosia did not show this bimanual constraint. We suggest that anosognosic patients may have intact motor intentionality and planning for the plegic hand. Rather than being merely an inexplicable confabulation, anosognosia for the plegic hand can produce objective constraints on what the intact hand does.},

@article{moore:2008_factors,
	Abstract = {Two experiments systematically examined factors that influence infants' manual search for hidden objects {(N\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;96).} Experiment 1 used a new procedure to assess infants' search for partially versus totally occluded objects. Results showed that 8.75-month-old infants solved partial occlusions by removing the occluder and uncovering the object, but these same infants failed to use this skill on total occlusions. Experiment 2 used sound-producing objects to provide a perceptual clue to the objects' hidden location. Sound clues significantly increased the success rate on total occlusions for 10-month-olds, but not for 8.75-month-olds. An identity development account is offered for why infants succeed on partial occlusions earlier than total occlusions and why sound helps only the older infants. We propose a mechanism for how infants use object identity as a basis for developing a notion of permanence. Implications are drawn for understanding the dissociation between looking time and search assessments of object permanence.},

@article{baillargeon:1991_object,
	Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that 4.5- and even 3.5-month-old infants realize that objects continue to exist when hidden. The goal of the present experiments was to obtain converging evidence of object permanence in young infants. Experiments were conducted using paradigms previously used to demonstrate object permanence in 5.5-month-old infants and 6.5-month-old infants. In one experiment, 3.5-month-old infants watched a short or a tall carrot slide along a track. The track's center was hidden by a screen with a large window in its upper half. The short carrot was shorter than the window's lower edge and so did not appear in the window when passing behind the screen; the tall carrot was taller than the window's lower edge and hence should have appeared in the window but did not. The infants looked reliably longer at the tall than at the short carrot event, suggesting that they (a) represented the existence, height, and trajectory of each carrot behind the screen and (b) expected the tall carrot to appear in the screen window and were surprised that it did not. Control trials supported this interpretation. In another experiment, 4.0-month-old infants saw a toy car roll along a track that was partly hidden by a screen. A large toy mouse was placed behind the screen, either on top or in back of the track. The female infants looked reliably longer when the mouse stood on top as opposed to in back of the track, suggesting that they (a) represented the existence and trajectory of the car behind the screen, (b) represented the existence and location of the mouse behind the screen, and (c) were surprised to see the car reappear from behind the screen when the mouse stood in its path. A second experiment supported this interpretation. The results of these experiments provide further evidence that infants aged 3.5 months and older are able to represent and to reason about hidden objects.},

@article{baillargeon:1985_object,
	Abstract = {A new method was devised to test object permanence in young infants. Five- month-old infants were habituated to a screen that moved back and forth through a 180-degree arc, in the manner of a drawbridge. After infants reached habituation, a box was centered behind the screen. Infants were shown two test events: a possible event and an impossible event. In the possible event, the screen stopped when it reached the occluded box; in the impossible event, the screen moved through the space occupied by the box. The results indicated that infants looked reliably longer at the impossible than at the possible event. This finding suggested that infants (1) understood that the box continued to exist, in its same location, after it was occluded by the screen, and (2) expected the screen to stop against the occluded box and were surprised, or puzzled, when it failed to do so. A control experiment in which the box was placed next to the screen provided support for this interpretation of the results. Together, the results of these experiments indicate that, contrary to Piaget's (1954) claims, infants as young as 5 months of age understand that objects continue to exist when occluded. The results also indicate that 5-month-old infants realize that solid objects do not move through the space occupied by other solid objects.},

@article{johansson:1973_visual,
	Abstract = {This paper reports the first phase of a research program on visual perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms in locomotion. Such motion patterns in animals and men are termed here as biological motion. They are characterized by a far higher degree of complexity than the patterns of simple mechanical motions usually studied in our laboratories. In everyday perceptions, the visual information from biological motion and from the corresponding figurative contour patterns (the shape of the body) are intermingled. A method for studying information from the motion pattern per se without interference with the form aspect was devised. In short, the motion of the living body was represented by a few bright spots describing the motions of the main joints. It is found that 10--12 such elements in adequate motion combinations in proximal stimulus evoke a compelling impression of human walking, running, dancing, etc. The kinetic-geometric model for visual vector analysis originally developed in the study of perception of motion combinations of the mechanical type was applied to these biological motion patterns. The validity of this model in the present context was experimentally tested and the results turned out to be highly positive.},

@article{pazzaglia:2008_sound_,
	Abstract = {Summary
Studies in nonhuman and human primates have demonstrated that sound-producing actions are mapped on the same mirror circuits that are activated during the visual recognition and execution of actions [1--12]. However, no causative link between the auditory recognition and execution of actions has been provided thus far. Here, we sought to determine whether patients with apraxia, who are by definition impaired in performing specific gestures, are also impaired in recognizing sounds specifically linked to human actions. Twenty-eight left-hemisphere-damaged patients with or without limb and/or buccofacial apraxia and seven right-hemisphere-damaged patients with no apraxia were asked to match sounds evoking human-related actions or nonhuman action sounds with specific visual pictures. Hand and mouth action-related sound recognition were specifically impaired in limb and buccofacial apraxia patients, respectively. Lesional mapping revealed that the left frontoparietal cortex is crucial for recognizing the sound of limb movements. By contrast, the left inferior frontal gyrus and adjacent insular cortex are causatively associated with recognition of buccofacial-related action sounds. These behavioral and neural double dissociations indicate that a left-lateralized multimodal mirror network is actively involved in the body-part-specific motor mapping of limb and mouth action-related sounds, as well as in the execution of the very same actions.},

@article{serino:2009_lesions_,
	Abstract = {Several studies have shown that the motor system is involved in action perception, suggesting that action concepts are represented through sensory--motor processes. Such conclusions imply that motor system impairments should diminish action perception. To test this hypothesis, a group of 10 brain-damaged patients with hemiplegia (specifically, a lesion at the motor system that affected the contralesional arm) viewed point-light displays of arm gestures and attempted to name each gesture. To create the dynamic stimuli, patients individually performed simple gestures with their unaffected arm while being videotaped. The videotapes were converted into point-light animations. Each action was presented as it had been performed, that is, as having been produced by the observer's unaffected arm, and in its mirror reversed orientation, that is, as having been produced by the observer's hemiplegic arm. Action recognition accuracy by patients with hemiplegia was compared with that by 8 brain-damaged patients without any motor deficit and by 10 healthy controls. Overall, performance was better in control observers than in patients. Most importantly, performance by hemiplegic patients, but not by nonhemiplegic patients and controls, varied systematically as a function of the observed limb. Action recognition was best when hemiplegic patients viewed actions that appeared to have been performed by their unaffected arm. Action recognition performance dropped significantly when hemiplegic patients viewed actions that appeared to have been produced with their hemiplegic arm or the corresponding arm of another person. The results of a control study involving the recognition of point-light defined animals in motion indicate that a generic deficit to visual and cognitive functions cannot account for this laterality-specific deficit in action recognition. Taken together, these results suggest that motor cortex impairment decreases visual sensitivity to human action. Specifically, when a cortical lesion renders an observer incapable of performing an observed action, action perception is compromised, possibly by a failure to map the observed action onto the observer's contralesional hemisoma.},

@article{ulloa:2007_recognition_,
	Abstract = {Changes in power in the mu frequency band {(8--13\&\#xa0;Hz)} of the electroencephalogram {(EEG)} is thought to indirectly reflect the activity of mirror neurons in premotor cortex. Activation of these neurons by self-performed, observed or imagined motor actions is assumed to produce asynchronous firing and a reduction in mu rhythm oscillation (referred to as mu suppression) in sensorimotor cortex. A recent {fMRI} study by Saygin et al. {[Saygin} {AP}, Wilson {SM}, Hagler Jr {DJ}, Bates E, Sereno {MI.} Point-light biological motion perception activates human premotor cortex. J Neurosci 2004;24:6181--8] revealed that the premotor brain regions containing mirror-neurons are also activated in response to point-light human motion. The perceived movement of these light cues are integrated into one percept of a complete human action (e.g. jumping jacks), rather than seen as individual moving lights. The present study examined whether recruitment of the mirror neuron system, as reflected in mu rhythm suppression, mediates recognition of point-light biological motion. Changes in mu power were recorded while subjects viewed point-light biological motion videos, matched scrambled versions of these animations, and visual white-noise (baseline). The results revealed that point-light biological animations produced mu suppression relative to baseline, while scrambled versions of these animations did not. This supports the hypothesis that the mirror neuron system is involved in inferring human actions by recovering object information from sparse input.},

@article{saygin:2004_point-light,
	Abstract = {Motion cues can be surprisingly powerful in defining objects and events. Specifically, a handful of point-lights attached to the joints of a human actor will evoke a vivid percept of action when the body is in motion. The perception of point-light biological motion activates posterior cortical areas of the brain. On the other hand, observation of others' actions is known to also evoke activity in motor and premotor areas in frontal cortex. In the present study, we investigated whether point-light biological motion animations would lead to activity in frontal cortex as well. We performed a human functional magnetic resonance imaging study on a high-field-strength magnet and used a number of methods to increase signal, as well as cortical surface-based analysis methods. Areas that responded selectively to point-light biological motion were found in lateral and inferior temporal cortex and in inferior frontal cortex. The robust responses we observed in frontal areas indicate that these stimuli can also recruit action observation networks, although they are very simplified and characterize actions by motion cues alone. The finding that even point-light animations evoke activity in frontal regions suggests that the motor system of the observer may be recruited to ``fill in'' these simplified displays.},

	Abstract = {The aim of our paper is to show that there is a sense of body that is enactive in nature and that enables to capture the most primitive sense of self. We will argue that the body is primarily given to us as source or power for action, i.e., as the variety of motor potentialities that define the horizon of the world in which we live, by populating it with things at hand to which we can be directed and with other bodies we can interact with. We will show that this sense of body as bodily self is, on the one hand, antecedent the distinction between sense of agency and sense of ownership, and, on the other, it enables and refines such distinction, providing a conceptual framework for the coherent interpretation of a variety of behavioral and neuropsychological data. We will conclude by positing that the basic experiences we entertain of our selves as bodily selves are from the very beginning driven by our interactions with other bodies as they are underpinned by the mirror mechanism.},

@article{zwickel:2010_interference,
	Abstract = {Recent studies have reported repulsion effects between the perception of visual motion and the concurrent production of hand movements. Two models, based on the notions of common coding and internal forward modeling, have been proposed to account for these phenomena. They predict that the size of the effects in perception and action should be monotonically related and vary with the amount of similarity between what is produced and perceived. These predictions were tested in four experiments in which participants were asked to make hand movements in certain directions while simultaneously encoding the direction of an independent stimulus motion. As expected, perceived directions were repelled by produced directions, and produced directions were repelled by perceived directions. However, contrary to the models, the size of the effects in perception and action did not covary, nor did they depend (as predicted) on the amount of perception--action similarity. We propose that such interactions are mediated by the activation of categorical representations.},

@article{bortoletto:2011_action,
	Abstract = {The current debate on mechanisms of action understanding and recognition has re-opened the question of how perceptual and motor systems are linked. It has been proposed that the human motor system has a role in action perception; however, there is still no direct evidence that actions can modulate early neural processes associated with perception of meaningful actions. Here we show that plans for action modulate the perceptual processing of observed actions within 200\&\#xa0;ms of stimulus onset. We examined event-related potentials to images of hand gestures presented while participants planned either a matching (congruent) or non-matching (incongruent) gesture. The {N170/VPP}, representing visual processing of hand gestures, was reliably altered when participants concurrently planned congruent versus incongruent actions. In a second experiment, we showed that this congruency effect was specific to action planning and not to more general semantic aspects of action representation. Our findings demonstrate that actions encoded via the motor system have a direct effect on visual processing, and thus imply a bi-directional link between action and perception in the human brain. We suggest that through forward modelling, intended actions can facilitate the encoding of sensory inputs that would be expected as a consequence of the action.},

@article{lambrey:2012_imagining,
	Abstract = {The capacity to imagine being somewhere else and seeing the environment from a different point of view is crucial for spatial planning in daily life and for understanding the intentions, actions, and state of mind of other people. The neural bases of spatial updating of multiple object locations were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Healthy volunteers saw an array of objects on a table in a virtual reality environment and imagined movement of their own viewpoint or rotation of the array. Their memory for the locations of the objects was then tested with a change-detection task. Behavioral results confirmed the advantage for imagined viewpoint change compared with imagined array rotation of equivalent size. Encoding of object locations was associated with a network of areas, including bilateral superior and inferior parietal cortices. The precuneus was additionally activated by the demands of both viewpoint- and array rotation. The parieto-occipital sulcus/retrosplenial cortex and hippocampus were additionally activated by the demands of viewpoint rotation, while array rotation was associated with activation of the right intraparietal sulcus. These findings support a computational model of spatial memory in which parieto-occipital sulcus/retrosplenial cortex mediates spatial updating as part of a process of translation between ``egocentric'' and ``allocentric'' reference frames.},

@article{scott:2012_verbal_fb,
	Abstract = {Recent research indicates that toddlers and infants succeed at various non-verbal spontaneous-response false-belief tasks; here we asked whether toddlers would also succeed at verbal spontaneous-response false-belief tasks that imposed significant linguistic demands. We tested 2.5-year-olds using two novel tasks: a preferential-looking task in which children listened to a false-belief story while looking at a picture book (with matching and non-matching pictures), and a violation-of-expectation task in which children watched an adult {`Subject'} answer (correctly or incorrectly) a standard false-belief question. Positive results were obtained with both tasks, despite their linguistic demands. These results (1) support the distinction between spontaneous- and elicited-response tasks by showing that toddlers succeed at verbal false-belief tasks that do not require them to answer direct questions about agents' false beliefs, (2) reinforce claims of robust continuity in early false-belief understanding as assessed by spontaneous-response tasks, and (3) provide researchers with new experimental tasks for exploring early false-belief understanding in neurotypical and autistic populations.},

	Abstract = {After a long period of neglect, the phenomenology of action has recently regained its place in the agenda of philosophers and scientists alike. The recent explosion of interest in the topic highlights its complexity. The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework allowing for a more precise characterization of the many facets of the phenomenology of agency, of how they are related and of their possible sources. The key assumption guiding this attempt is that the processes through which the phenomenology of action is generated and the processes involved in the specification and control of action are strongly interconnected. I argue in favor of a three-tiered dynamic model of intention, link it to an expanded version of the internal model theory of action control and specification, and use this theoretical framework to guide an analysis of the contents, possible sources and temporal course of complementary aspects of the phenomenology of action.},

Moreover, recent findings suggest that the motor system could also have a role in recognition of body parts. To address these issues in the present study we assessed patients with a complete damage of descending motor pathways (locked-in syndrome, {LIS)} on the hand laterality task, requiring subjects to decide whether a hand stimulus in a given spatial orientation represents a left or a right hand. {LIS} patients were less accurate than healthy controls in judging hand laterality; more importantly, {LIS} patients' performance was modulated by spatial orientation of hand stimuli whereas it was not affected by biomechanical constraints. These findings demonstrate a dissociation between spared hand recognition and impaired access to action simulation processes in {LIS} patients.},

@article{ramsey:2010_incongruent_,
	Abstract = {It has been suggested that representing an action through observation and imagery share neural processes with action execution. In support of this view, motor-priming research has shown that observing an action can influence action initiation. However, there is little motor-priming research showing that imagining an action can modulate action initiation. The current study examined whether action imagery could prime subsequent execution of a reach and grasp action. Across two motion analysis tracking experiments, 40 participants grasped an object following congruent or incongruent action imagery. In Experiment 1, movement initiation was faster following congruent compared to incongruent imagery, demonstrating that imagery can prime the initiation of grasping. In Experiment 2, incongruent imagery resulted in slower movement initiation compared to a no-imagery control. These data show that imagining a different action to that which is performed can interfere with action production. We propose that the most likely neural correlates of this interference effect are brain regions that code imagined and executed actions. Further, we outline a plausible mechanistic account of how priming in these brain regions through imagery could play a role in action cognition.},

A similar enhancement in detection thresholds was obtained when observers imagined the previously perceived masks. Imagery-induced facilitation was detected for as long as 5 minutes after observation of the masks by the targeted eye. These results indicated the existence of a low-level (monocular) memory that stores the sensory trace for several minutes and enables reactivation of early representations by higher processes. This memory, with its iconic nature, may subserve the interface between mental images and percepts.},

We found functional equivalency in cortical activity by recording evoked potentials while color and luminance patterns were viewed and while they were visualized with the eyes closed. Cortical responses were found to be different when imagining a color pattern vs. imagining a checkerboard luminance pattern, but the same when imagining a color pattern (or checkerboard pattern) vs. seeing the same pattern. This suggests that early visual processing stages may play a dynamic role in internal image generation, and further implies that visual imagery may modulate perception.},

	Abstract = {People in these experiments claimed to be able to imagine moving only a given distance toward some imaged object before it seemed to ``overflow,'' not remaining all visible at once in their mental images. In addition, the larger the imaged object, the further away it seemed at the point of overflow. Although the angle subtended by the imaged objects at the point of overflow did not vary systematically with the size of the object, it did vary with different stimuli and instructions. These disparities in the size of the angle estimated seemed partly due to differences in criterion of ``overflow'': Images seem to fade off gradually toward the periphery and not to occur in a spatial medium with sharply defined edges. When subjects were given a relatively strict definition of ``overflow,'' similar estimates of the ``visual angle of the mind's eye'' were obtained with three distinct methods: (1) Asking subjects to estimate the apparent distance at which an imaged horizontal ruler began to overflow; (2) Measuring how much time subjects required to scan across each degree of an imaged line, and then inferring the maximal angle from the time required to scan an image of a longest nonoverflowing line; and, (3) Simply asking subjects to hold up their hands to indicate the subjective size of an image of the longest possible nonoverflowing line. Finally, the maximal subjective size of images seemed related to the scope of ``focal'' vision, and images tended to be constructed spontaneously at about the maximal size.},

Gaze was independent of complement mastery. These patterns held when other low-verbal false-belief tasks were considered and the predictive looking task was presented as a time-controlled film. While implicit (gaze) knowledge predicted explicit (verbal) false-belief understanding, complement mastery and cognitive flexibility also supported explicit reasoning. Overall, explicit false-belief understanding is complexly underpinned by implicit knowledge and input from higher-order systems of language and executive control.},

	Abstract = {Abstract:  Our objectives in this article are to bring some theoretical order into developmental sequences and simultaneities in children's ability to appreciate multiple labels for single objects, to reason with identity statements, to reason hypothetically, counterfactually, and with beliefs and desires, and to explain why an `implicit' understanding of belief occurs before an `explicit' understanding. The central idea behind our explanation is the emerging grasp of how objects of thought and desire relate to real objects and to each other. To capture this idea we make use of the notion of discourse referents, as did Perner and Brandl (2005), to explain the developmental link between understanding beliefs and alternative naming. We present confirming evidence of the prediction from this analysis that children should have comparable problems with understanding identity statements. We explain the precociously correct answers in `implicit' false belief tests based on indirect measures in the following way: From infancy children are able to keep track of other people's experiences, to reason about counterfactual circumstances, and to reason about goal-directed (rational) action depending on given circumstances. Indirect tasks reduce the bias to use actual circumstances for reasoning about goal directed action compared to the traditional task, which leads to more correct answers. An emerging metarepresentational understanding helps overcome these biases and enables not only correct action prediction but also the explanation of erroneous actions. The common metarepresentational element explains why false belief tasks and the alternative naming task are mastered at the same time as children understand identity statements.},

Prior studies yielding individual differences data suggested that counterfactual thinking may be related to overcoming prepotent responses. In two experiments, we manipulated how 3- to 5-year-olds responded to counterfactual conditional and syllogism tasks. In Experiment 1 {(N\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;39)}, children's performance improved on both conditional and syllogism tasks when they responded with an arrow rather than pointing with a finger. In Experiment 2 {(N\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;42)}, 3- and 4-year-olds benefited from both an arrow manipulation and, separately, the introduction of a delay before responding. We suggest that both manipulations help children to overcome an impulsive prepotent response to counterfactual questions arising from a default assumption that information about the past is true.},

Previous evidence suggested that children start to consider these close counterfactuals at around 2 years of age {(P.} L. Harris, 1997), substantially earlier than they pass other tests of counterfactual thinking. However, this success appears to result from false positives. In Experiment 1 {(N} = 41), 3- and 4-year-olds could identify a character who almost completed an action when the comparison did not complete it. However, in Experiments 1 and 2 {(N} = 98), children performed poorly when the comparison character completed the action. In Experiment 3 {(N} = 28), 5- and 6-year-olds consistently passed the task, indicating that they made appropriate counterfactual interpretations of the ``almost'' statements. This understanding of close counterfactuals proved more difficult than standard counterfactuals.},

Basic conditional reasoning occurs when one applies typical regularities (such as {``If} `whenever' it doesn't rain the street is dry'') to counterfactual questions (such as {``If} it had not rained, would the street be wet or dry?'') without regard to actual events (e.g., if street cleaners had just been washing the street).

In situations when counterfactual reasoning and basic conditional reasoning would yield the same answers, even the youngest children gave mostly correct answers.

Attempts to measure motor imagery on a subjective scale have met with limited success but alternative methods are proposed. Research on mental practice suggests a number of different processes may be needed to explain the variety and variability of effects obtained. Recent studies of spatial and motor working memory signify the importance of a primarily visuo-spatial component in which actions are consciously represented together with a more properly motoric component which must be activated to generate either images or overt actions. Finally the question of whether motor imagery is primarily perceptual or motoric in character does not have a simple neurophysiological answer due to the highly distributed nature of motor control. Nevertheless some of the key mechanisms serving both spatial and motoric components have been provisionally identified.},

On one account, chimpanzees are seen as possessing a psychological system for social cognition that represents and reasons about behaviors alone. A competing account allows that the chimpanzee's social cognition system additionally construes the behaviors it represents in terms of mental states. Because the range of behaviors that each of the two systems can generate is not currently known, and because the latter system depends upon the former, determining the presence of this latter system in chimpanzees is a far more difficult task than has been assumed. We call for recognition of this problem, and a shift from experimental paradigms that cannot resolve this question, to ones that might allow researchers to intelligently determine when it is necessary to postulate the presence of a system which reasons about both behavior and mental states.},

	Abstract = {This study employed a new ``anticipatory intervening'' paradigm to tease apart false belief and ignorance-based interpretations of 18-month-olds' helpful informing. We investigated in three experiments whether 18-month-old infants inform an adult selectively about one of the two locations depending on the adult's belief about which of the two locations held her toy. In experiments 1 and 2, the adult falsely believed that one of the locations held her toy. In experiment 3, the adult was ignorant about which of the two locations held her toy. In all cases, however, the toy had been removed from the locations and the locations contained instead materials which the adult wanted to avoid. In experiments 1 and 2, infants spontaneously and selectively informed the adult about the aversive material in the location the adult falsely believed to hold her toy. In contrast, in experiment 3, infants informed the ignorant adult about both locations equally. Results reveal that infants expected the adult to commit a specific action mistake when she held a false belief, but not when she was ignorant. Further, infants were motivated to intervene proactively. Findings reveal a predictive action-based usage of ``theory-of-mind'' skills at 18 months of age.},

	Abstract = {People commonly interpret others' behavior in terms of the actors' underlying beliefs, knowledge, or other mental states, thereby using their ``theory of mind.'' Two experiments suggest that using one's theory of mind is a relatively effortful process. In both experiments, people reflexively used their own knowledge and beliefs to follow a speaker's instruction, but only effortfully used their theory of mind to take into account a speaker's intention to interpret those instructions. In Experiment 1, people with lower working memory capacity were less effective than people with larger working memory capacity in applying their theory of mind to interpret behavior. In Experiment 2, an attention-demanding secondary task reduced people's ability to apply their theory of mind. People appear to be reflexively mindblind, interpreting behavior in terms of the actor's mental states only to the extent that they have the cognitive resources to do so.},

	Abstract = {The close integration between visual and motor processes suggests that some visuomotor transformations may proceed automatically and to an extent that permits observable effects on subsequent actions. A series of experiments investigated the effects of visual objects on motor responses during a categorisation task. In Experiment 1 participants responded according to an object's natural or manufactured category. The responses consisted in uni-manual precision or power grasps that could be compatible or incompatible with the viewed object. The data indicate that object grasp compatibility significantly affected participant response times and that this did not depend upon the object being viewed within the reaching space. The time course of this effect was investigated in Experiments 2?4b by using a go-nogo paradigm with responses cued by tones and go-nogo trials cued by object category. The compatibility effect was not present under advance response cueing and rapidly diminished following object extinction. A final experiment established that the compatibility effect did not depend on a within-hand response choice, but was at least as great with bi-manual responses where a full power grasp could be used. Distributional analyses suggest that the effect is not subject to rapid decay but increases linearly with {RT} whilst the object remains visible. The data are consistent with the view that components of the actions an object affords are integral to its representation.

	Abstract = {Accounts of visually directed actions usually assume that their planning begins with an intention to act. This article describes three experiments that challenged this view through the use of a stimulus--response compatibility paradigm with photographs of common graspable objects as stimuli. Participants had to decide as fast as possible whether each object was upright or inverted. Experiments 1 and 2 examined the effect of the irrelevant dimension of left--right object orientation on bimanual and unimanual keypress responses. Experiment 3 examined wrist rotation responses to objects requiring either clockwise or anticlockwise wrist rotations when grasped. The results (a) are consistent with the view that seen objects automatically potentiate components of the actions they afford, (b) show that compatibility effects of an irrelevant stimulus dimension can be obtained across a wide variety of naturally occurring stimuli, and (c) support the view that intentions to act operate on already existing motor representations of the possible actions in a visual scene.},

Neurophysiol. 78: 2226--2230, 1997. Visual and motor properties of single neurons of monkey ventral premotor cortex (area F5) were studied in a behavioral paradigm consisting of four conditions: object grasping in light, object grasping in dark, object fixation, and fixation of a spot of light. The employed objects were six different three-dimensional {(3-D)} geometric solids. Two main types of neurons were distinguished: motor neurons (n = 25) and visuomotor neurons (n = 24). Motor neurons discharged in association with grasping movements. Most of them (n = 17) discharged selectively during a particular type of grip. Different objects, if grasped in similar way, determined similar neuronal motor responses. Visuomotor neurons also discharged during active movements, but, in addition, they fired also in response to the presentation of {3-D} objects. The majority of visuomotor neurons (n = 16) showed selectivity for one or few objects. The response was present both in object grasping in light and in object fixation conditions. Visuomotor neurons that selectively discharged to the presentation of a given object discharged also selectively during grasping of that object. In conclusion, object shape is coded in F5 even when a response to that object is not required. The possible visual or motor nature of this object coding is discussed.},

         of the neuronal discharge during both observation and grasping of many different three-dimensional objects with and without
         visual guidance. All neurons displayed a preference for grasping of an object or a set of objects. The same preference was
         maintained when grasping was performed in the dark without visual feedback. In addition to the motor-related discharge, about
         half of the neurons also responded to the presentation of an object or a set of objects, even when a grasping movement was
         not required. Often the object evoking the strongest activity during grasping also evoked optimal activity during its visual
         presentation. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that the selectivity of both the motor and the visual discharge of the
         F5 neurons is determined not by the object shape but by the grip posture used to grasp the object. Because the same paradigm
         has been used to study the properties of hand-grasping neurons in the dorsal premotor area F2, and in the anterior intraparietal
         area {(AIP)}, a comparison of the functional properties of grasping-related neurons in the three cortical areas {(F5}, F2, {AIP)}

@article{cardellicchio:2011_space,
	Abstract = {Previous studies have shown a motor recruitment during the observation of graspable objects. This recruitment has been considered crucial in encoding the observed objects in terms of one or more potential motor acts. However, an agent can actually act upon an object only when the latter is close enough to be reached. Thus, the question we deal with in this paper is whether the motor system is always activated whenever a graspable object comes into view or whether it requires the object to be located within the reachable space of the perceiver.

The left primary motor cortex was magnetically stimulated and motor evoked potentials {(MEPs)} were recorded while participants observed graspable and non graspable objects located within or outside their own reachable space. We found higher {MEPs} during the observation of graspable objects falling within the reachable space compared to the observation of either a non graspable object or a graspable object falling outside the reachable space.

Our results shed new light on the functional role of the motor system in encoding visually presented objects. Indeed, they clearly indicate that its recruitment is spatially constrained, as it depends on whether the object falls within the actual reaching space of the onlooker.},

@article{chao_representation_2000,
	Abstract = {We used {fMRI} to examine the neural response in frontal and parietal cortices associated with viewing and naming pictures of different categories of objects. Because tools are commonly associated with specific hand movements, we predicted that pictures of tools, but not other categories of objects, would elicit activity in regions of the brain that store information about motor-based properties. We found that viewing and naming pictures of tools selectively activated the left ventral premotor cortex {(BA} 6). Single-unit recording studies in monkeys have shown that neurons in the rostral part of the ventral premotor cortex (canonical F5 neurons) respond to the visual presentation of graspable objects, even in the absence of any subsequent motor activity. Thus, the left ventral premotor region that responded selectively to tools in the current study may be the human homolog of the monkey canonical F5 area. Viewing and naming tools also selectively activated the left posterior parietal cortex {(BA} 40). This response is similar to the firing of monkey anterior intraparietal neurons to the visual presentation of graspable objects. In humans and monkeys, there appears to be a close link between manipulable objects and information about the actions associated with their use. The selective activation of the left posterior parietal and left ventral premotor cortices by pictures of tools suggests that the ability to recognize and identify at least one category of objects (tools) may depend on activity in specific sites of the ventral and dorsal visual processing streams.},

@article{buccino:2009_broken,
	Abstract = {It is well known that specific components of motor programs are automatically activated when they are afforded by object related pragmatic features. Among these features the handle appears to be particularly salient for interacting with an object. The aim of this study was to test the modulation of the motor system when object features, particularly relevant for the action, like the object's handle, are violated. In order to address this issue a {TMS} paradigm was used in which familiar objects with a whole or broken handle, positioned to the right or to the left, were centrally presented. A control condition was also included in which a symbol ('\#' character) was shown in the right or in the left visual field. Participants had to watch stimuli carefully. The left hemisphere hand motor area was magnetically stimulated 200 ms after stimulus presentation. Results showed that {MEP} areas were larger when the handle was located to the right side consistent with the visuomotor role of this feature, but only when the handle was complete. The present data (1) suggest a more active role of the dorsal stream in building up object knowledge and (2) allow one to rule out the role of any asymmetrical aspect of an object in motor coding.},

Little is known about how information computed by dorsal-stream structures influences object recognition. We used continuous flash suppression to functionally separate information computed by the dorsal stream from that computed by the ventral stream. We show that information originating from the dorsal stream influences not only decisions requiring the selection of superordinate category labels, but also decisions that entail the selection of a basic-level object. We further show that information computed by the dorsal stream does not carry specific functional information about objects. Our results indicate that the dorsal stream, in isolation from the ventral stream, is agnostic as to the identity of the objects that it processes. We suggest that structures within the dorsal visual processing stream compute motor-relevant information (e.g., graspability), which influences the identification of manipulable objects, and is not either about the function of the object or function-specific.},

@article{jeannerod:2003_mechanism,
	Abstract = {Recognizing oneself as the owner of a body and the agent of actions requires specific mechanisms which have been elucidated only recently. One of these mechanisms is the monitoring of signals arising from bodily movements, i.e. the central signals which contribute to the generation of the movements and the sensory signals which arise from their execution. The congruence between these two sets of signals is a strong index for determining the experiences of ownership and agency, which are the main constituents of the experience of being an independent self. This mechanism, however, does not account from the frequent cases where an intention is generated but the corresponding action is not executed. In this paper, it is postulated that such covert actions are internally simulated by activating specific cortical networks or representations of the intended actions. This process of action simulation is also extended to the observation and the recognition of actions performed or intended by other agents. The problem of disentangling representations that pertain to self-intended actions from those that pertain to actions executed or intended by others, is a critical one for attributing actions to their respective agents. Failure to recognize one's own actions and misattribution of actions may result from pathological conditions which alter the readability of these representations.},

	Abstract = {Motor imagery typically involves an experience as of moving a body part. Recent studies reveal close parallels between the constraints on motor imagery and those on actual motor performance. How are these parallels to be explained? We advance a simulative theory of motor imagery, modeled on the idea that we predict and explain the decisions of others by simulating their decision-making processes. By proposing that motor imagery is essentially off-line motor action, we explain the tendency of motor imagery to mimic motor performance. We close by arguing that a simulative theory of motor imagery gives (modest) support to and illumination of the simulative theory of decision-prediction.},

I distinguish token-demonstratives, that pick out individuals, from type-demonstratives, that pick out kinds, or properties, and provide a similar treatment for both. I argue that it follows from my model of demonstrative thought, as well as from independent considerations, that demonstration, as a mental act, operates directly on mental representations, not external objects. That is, though the relation between a demonstrative and the object or property demonstrated is semantically direct, the mechanism by which a demonstrative acquires its referent involves mediation by a perceptual representation. Finally, I argue that so-called `demonstrative concepts'---which I treat as type-demonstratives---cannot perform the various philosophical functions that have been assigned to them.},

Image and Brain marshals insights and empirical results from computer vision, neuroscience, and cognitive science to develop a general theory of visual mental imagery, its relation to visual perception, and its implementation in the human brain. It offers a definitive resolution to the long-standing debate about the nature of the internal representation of visual mental {imagery.Kosslyn} reviews evidence that perception and representation are inextricably linked, and goes on to show how "quasi-pictorial" events in the brain are generated, interpreted, and used in cognition. The theory is tested with brain- scanning techniques that provide stronger evidence than has been possible in the {past.Known} for his work in high-level vision, one of the most empirically successful areas of experimental psychology, Kosslyn uses a highly interdisciplinary approach.

The kinematic configuration of the body represented and transformed in mental simulations was not fixed or canonical but corresponded to one's current configuration. Mental simulation time mimicked movement time for natural efficient movement from a posture midway between each of the hand's joint limits into many other postures. Equal time was required for simulated and real movements into more common, comfortable postures; shorter but proportional time was required for simulated movement than real movement into less common postures that involved longer trajectories, coordinated activity at more joints, motion near extremes of joint limits, and uncomfortable kinesthetic sensations. The findings suggest that sensorimotor structures support mental simulations of actions.},

@article{mercier:2008_vision,
	Abstract = {Several studies have shown a cortico-spinal facilitation during motor imagery. This facilitation effect is weaker when the actual hand posture is incompatible with the imagined movement. To determine whether the source of this interference effect arises from online proprioceptive information, we examined transcranial magnetic stimulation {(TMS)-induced} motor-evoked potentials during motor imagery in the deafferented subject {G.L.} The patient and 7 control subjects were asked to close their eyes and imagine joining the tips of the thumb and the little finger while maintaining a hand posture compatible or incompatible with the imagined movement. Contrary to control subjects' performance, {G.L.'s} results show that the facilitation observed during motor imagery was independent of the hand posture. To examine how vision of the hand interacts with the imagery process, {G.L.} and control subjects performed the same task with the eyes open. Like control subjects, when {G.L.} looked at her hand, a greater facilitation was observed when her hand posture was compatible with the imagined movement than when it was incompatible. These results suggest that in the absence of proprioception, vision may facilitate or inhibit motor representations and support the idea that limb position in the brain is organized around multisensory representations.},

Subjects were asked to imagine themselves joining the tips of the thumb and the little finger while they maintained one of the two following hand postures: posture A {(PA}, compatible), little finger, index and thumb extended, the remaining fingers flexed; or posture B {(PB}, incompatible), index and thumb extended, other fingers flexed. All subjects rated the imagined finger opposition movements as easier to perform when the hand was kept in {PA} than in {PB} {(P} {\textless} 0.01) and the correlation between the duration of motor imagery and movement execution was also higher for {PA} than {PB} {(P} {\textless} 0.01). For each posture, motor evoked potentials {(MEPs)} elicited by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation {(TMS)} of the left motor cortex were recorded from the right opponens pollicis muscle during both motor imagery {(MI)} and rest {(R)} conditions. {MEP} area varied according to the hand posture: {PA} induced a higher increase in corticospinal excitability, when compared with {PB.} These results indicate that the actual limb posture affects the process of motor imagery.

@article{fourkas:2006_influence,
	Abstract = {Single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation {(TMS)} was used to test the assumption that kinesthetic imagery of action is more `motor' than visual imagery of action. We assessed corticospinal excitability during motor imagery of a thumb-palm opposition movement by recording potentials evoked by {TMS} from two hand muscles that would (opponens pollicis, {OP}, target) or would not (abductor digiti minimi, {ADM}, control) be activated during actual performance of the very same movement. Participants were asked to imagine the thumb-palm opposition movement while maintaining first person imagery that was either purely visual or predominately kinesthetic. The motor imagery task was performed in two conditions in which the imagined and the actual hand could be either congruent or incongruent. Facilitation of potentials recorded from {OP} was higher during imagery carried out in mentally congruent than incongruent postures. This effect was largely due to lack of excitability recorded during incongruent kinesthetic imagery, which was indistinguishable from baseline imagery of the static hand. All other conditions differed from static imagery regardless of position. No significant effects were found in a control muscle {(ADM)} thus indicating that the effect was not related to spatial coding. Subjective reports obtained after the experiment indicate that the results cannot be ascribed to qualitative differences in the imagery experienced. For relatively simple motor tasks requiring no `expertise' we found no detectable difference in the motor cortex due to imagery modality.},

@article{nico:2004_left,
	Abstract = {Previous research suggests a close similarity in brain activity between mental simulation of a movement and its real counterpart. To explore this similarity, we aimed to assess whether imagery is affected by the loss of a limb or of its motor skills. We examined the performance of 16 adult, upper limb amputees (and age‐matched controls) in a left/right hand judgement task that implicitly requires motor imagery. The experimental group included subjects who had suffered the amputation of the dominant or the non‐dominant limb. Although responding well above chance, amputees as a group were slower and less accurate than controls. Nevertheless, their response pattern was similar to that of controls, namely slower response times and more errors for stimuli depicting hands in unnatural orientations, i.e. postures difficult to reach with a real movement. Interestingly, for all stimuli, amputees' performance was strongly affected by the side of limb loss: subjects who underwent amputation of their preferred limb made more errors and required greater latencies to respond as compared with amputees of the non‐dominant limb. In a further analysis we observed that the habit of wearing an aesthetic prosthesis significantly interfered with the ability to judge the corresponding hand. Our data lead to three main conclusions: (i) loss of a single limb per se does not prevent motor imagery but it significantly enhances its difficulty; (ii) these subjects apparently perform the hand recognition task using a strategy in which they initially mentally simulate movements of their dominant limb; (iii) wearing a prosthesis, devoid of any motor function, seems to interfere with motor imagery, consistent with the view that only `tools' can be incorporated in a dynamic body schema.},

	Abstract = {Abstract.   Five normal subjects were tested in a simulated grasping task. A cylindrical container filled with water was placed on the center of a horizontal monitor screen. Subjects used a precision grip formed by the thumb and index finger of their right hand. After a preliminary run during which the container was present, it was replaced by an image of the upper surface of the cylinder appearing on the horizontal computer screen on which the real cylinder was placed during the preliminary run. In each trial the image was marked with two contact points which defined an opposition axis in various orientations with respect to the frontal plane. The subjects' task consisted, once shown a stimulus, of judging as quickly as possible whether the previously experienced action of grasping the container full of water and pouring the water out would be easy, difficult or impossible with the fingers placed according to the opposition axis indicated on the circle. Response times were found to be longer for the grasps judged to be more difficult due to the orientation and position of the opposition axis. In a control experiment, three subjects actually performed the grasps with different orientations and positions of the opposition axis. The effects of these parameters on response time followed the same trends as during simulated movements. This result shows that simulated hand movements take into account the same biomechanical limitations as actually performed movements.},

In Expt. 1, subjects selected as good visual imagers were instructed to build up a mental representation of the target. Then they had to either actually walk or imagine themselves walking to the target. Walking time was measured in both the actual and the mental performance. It was found that subjects took almost exactly the same time in the two conditions. Accuracy of these subjects was also measured in the actual walking task. They were found to make no direction errors and to slightly overshoot target location. Subjects from another, control, group, who received no instructions about visual imagery made much larger errors. In Expt. 2, actual and mental walking times were measured in the same subjects as in Expt. 1, while they carried a 25-kg weight on their shoulders. In this condition, actual walking time was the same as in Expt. 1, although mental walking time was found to increase systematically by about 30\%. These results are discussed in terms of the neural parameters encoded in the motor program for actually executing or mentally performing an action.},

The task involved imagining a hand in a particular orientation in space and making a subsequent laterality judgement. A simple change in the phrasing of the imagery instructions (first-person or third-person imagery) and in actual hand posture (holding the hands on the lap or in the back) had a strong impact on response time {(RT)} in normal subjects, and on response accuracy in brain-damaged subjects. The pattern of results indicates that the activation of covert motor and visual processes during mental imagery depends on both top-down and bottom-up factors, and highlights the distinct but complementary contribution of covert motor and visual processes during mental rotation.},

Subjects were asked to reach to and grasp various objects under three experimental conditions: (1) memory-guided movements, in which the object was not in view during the movement; (2) virtual object, in which a virtual image of the object was in view but the object was not physically present; and (3) real object, in which the object was in view and physically present. Motion of the arm and of 15 degrees of freedom of the hand was recorded. A principal components analysis was developed to provide a concise description of the spatiotemporal patterns underlying the motion. Vision of the object during the reaching movement had no influence on the kinematics, and the effect of the physical presence of the object became manifest primarily after the fingers had contacted the object. Two principal components accounted for {\textgreater}75\% of the variance. For both components, there was a strong positive correlation in the rotations of metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. The first principal component exhibited a pattern of finger extension reversing to flexion, whereas the second principal component became important only in the second half of the reaching movement.},

@article{mason:2001_hand,
	Abstract = {An emerging viewpoint is that the {CNS} uses synergies to simplify the control of the hand. Previous work has shown that static hand postures for mimed grasps can be described by a few principal components in which the higher order components explained only a small fraction of the variance yet provided meaningful information. Extending that earlier work, this study addressed whether the entire act of grasp can be described by a small number of postural synergies and whether these synergies are similar for different grasps. Five right-handed adults performed five types of reach-to-grasps including power grasp, power grasp with a lift, precision grasp, and mimed power grasp and mimed precision grasp of 16 different objects. The object shapes were cones, cylinders, and spindles, systematically varied in size to produce a large range of finger joint angle combinations. Three-dimensional reconstructions of 21 positions on the hand and wrist throughout the reach-to-grasp were obtained using a four-camera video system. Singular value decomposition on the temporal sequence of the marker positions was used to identify the common patterns (``eigenpostures'') across the 16 objects for each task and their weightings as a function of time. The first eigenposture explained an average of 97.3 $\pm$ 0.89\% (mean $\pm$ {SD)} of the variance of the hand shape, and the second another 1.9 $\pm$ 0.85\%. The first eigenposture was characterized by an open hand configuration that opens and closes during reach. The second eigenposture contributed to the control of the thumb and long fingers, particularly in the opening of the hand during the reach and the closing in preparation for object grasp. The eigenpostures and their temporal evolutions were similar across subjects and grasps. The higher order eigenpostures, although explaining only small amounts of the variance, contributed to the movements of the fingers and thumb. These findings suggest that much of reach-to-grasp is effected using a base posture with refinements in finger and thumb positions added in time to yield unique hand shapes.},

	Abstract = {The capacity to use tools is a fundamental evolutionary achievement. Its essence stands in the capacity to transfer a proximal goal (grasp a tool) to a distal goal (e.g., grasp food). Where and how does this goal transfer occur? Here, we show that, in monkeys trained to use tools, cortical motor neurons, active during hand grasping, also become active during grasping with pliers, as if the pliers were now the hand fingers. This motor embodiment occurs both for normal pliers and for ``reverse pliers,'' an implement that requires finger opening, instead of their closing, to grasp an object. We conclude that the capacity to use tools is based on an inherently goal-centered functional organization of primate cortical motor areas.},

	Abstract = {Based on theoretical and computational studies it has been suggested that the central nervous system {(CNS)} internally simulates the behaviour of the motor system in planning, control and learning. Such an internal ``forward'' model is a representation of the motor system that uses the current state of the motor system and motor command to predict the next state. We will outline the uses of such internal models for solving several fundamental computational problems in motor control and then review the evidence for their existence and use by the {CNS.} Finally we speculate how the location of an internal model within the {CNS} may be identified.

	Abstract = {It is well known that ventral premotor area F5 codes the goal of executed and observed motor acts. This area is anatomically connected with part of the inferior parietal cortex (area {PFG)}, which has been recently shown to play a role in action organization and intention understanding. The aims of the present study were 1) to assess whether the discharge of F5 motor neurons and mirror neurons {(MNs)} codes action goals and 2) to clarify the relative contribution of F5 and {PFG} in action organization and intention understanding. To this purpose, we first recorded from F5 motor neurons and {MNs} of 2 monkeys while performing a motor task constituted by 2 actions (``grasp-to-eat'' and ``grasp-to-place'') or observing the same task done by an experimenter. Results showed that some F5 neurons code grasping according to the goal of the action in which it is embedded. Subsequently, we recorded from {PFG} motor neurons and {MNs} of the same monkeys, using the same tasks. The comparison between the neuronal properties of F5 and {PFG} motor neurons suggests that {PFG} plays a major role in organizing natural actions. Furthermore, the similarities between {MNs} properties of the 2 areas indicate that they constitute a functional circuit underlying others' intention understanding.},

@article{cattaneo:2007_impairment,
	Abstract = {Experiments in monkeys demonstrated that many parietal and premotor neurons coding a specific motor act (e.g., grasping) show a markedly different activation when this act is part of actions that have different goals (e.g., grasping for eating vs. grasping for placing). Many of these ``action-constrained'' neurons have mirror properties firing selectively to the observation of the initial motor act of the actions to which they belong motorically. By activating a specific action chain from its very outset, this mechanism allows the observers to have an internal copy of the whole action before its execution, thus enabling them to understand directly the agent's intention. Using electromyographic recordings, we show that a similar chained organization exists in typically developing children, whereas it is impaired in children with autism. We propose that, as a consequence of this functional impairment, high-functioning autistic children may understand the intentions of others cognitively but lack the mechanism for understanding them experientially.},

	Abstract = {We recorded motor-evoked potentials {(MEPs)} to transcranial magnetic stimulation from the right opponens pollicis {(OP)} muscle while participants observed an experimenter operating two types of pliers: pliers opened by the extension of the fingers and closed by their flexion (``normal pliers'') and pliers opened by the flexion of the fingers and closed by their extension (``reverse pliers''). In one experimental condition, the experimenter merely opened and closed the pliers; in the other, he grasped an object with them. In a further condition, the participants imagined themselves operating the normal and reverse pliers. During the observation of actions devoid of a goal, the {MEP} amplitudes, regardless of pliers used, reflected the muscular pattern involved in the execution of the observed action. In contrast, during the observation of goal-directed actions, the {MEPs} from {OP} were modulated by the action goal, increasing during goal achievement despite the opposite hand movements necessary to obtain it. During motor imagery, the {MEPs} recorded from {OP} reflected the muscular pattern required to perform the imagined action. We propose that covert activity in the human motor cortex may reflect different aspects of motor behavior. Imagining oneself performing tool actions or observing tool actions devoid of a goal activates the representation of the hand movements that correspond to the observed ones. In contrast, the observation of tool actions with a goal incorporates the distal part of the tool in the observer's body schema, resulting in a higher-order representation of the meaning of the motor act.},

@article{cattaneo:2010_state-dependent,
	Abstract = {A transcranial magnetic stimulation {(TMS)} adaptation paradigm was used to investigate the neural representation of observed motor behavior in the inferior parietal lobule {(IPL)}, ventral premotor cortex {(PMv)}, and in the cortex around the superior temporal sulcus {(STS).} Participants were shown adapting movies of a hand or a foot acting on different objects and were asked to compare to the movie, a motor act shown in test pictures. The invariant features between adapting and test stimuli fitted a 2 × 2 design: same or different action made by the same or different effector. Neuronavigated {TMS} pulses were delivered at the onset of each test picture. {TMS} over the left and right {PMv} and over the left {IPL} induced a selective shortening of reaction times {(RTs)} to stimuli showing a repeated (adapted) action, regardless of the effector performing it. In a second experiment, {TMS} applied over the left {STS} induced shortening of {RTs} for adapted actions but only if also the effector was repeated. The results indicate that observed motor behavior is encoded with the body part that performs it in the temporal lobe. A hierarchically higher level of representation is carried by neural populations in the parietofrontal regions, where acts are encoded in an abstract way.},

@article{koch:2010_resonance,
	Abstract = {Goal directed movements require the activation of parietal, premotor and primary motor areas. In monkeys, neurons of these areas become active also during the observation of movements performed by others, especially for coding the goal of the action (mirror system). Using bifocal transcranial magnetic stimulation {(TMS)} in healthy subjects, we tested whether the observation of goal directed reach to grasp actions may lead to specific changes in the short-latency connections linking key areas of the mirror system, such as the anterior intraparietal cortex {(AIP)} and the ventral premotor cortex {(PMv)}, with the primary motor cortex {(M1).} We found that {AIP-M1} and {PMv-M1} cortico--cortical interactions were specifically activated when observing successful reaching to grasp goal directed actions, in which the hand posture was congruent with the goal of the action performed by the actor. On the other hand they were not modified when the same goal directed actions were performed wrongly with an inappropriate grasping posture. A similar profile of excitability was observed when testing specific intracortical facilitatory circuits in M1 {(I2-waves)}, known to reflect the activity in cortico--cortical pathways transmitting information from {PMv.} We conclude that the simple observation of others' goal directed actions is able to induce specific neurophysiological changes in some cortico--cortical circuits of the human motor system.},

	Abstract = {This study investigated infants' rapid learning of two novel words using a preferential looking measure compared with a preferential reaching measure. In Experiment 1, 21 13-month-olds and 20 17-month-olds were given 12 novel label exposures (6 per trial) for each of two novel objects. Next, in the label comprehension tests, infants were shown both objects and were asked, {``Where's} the [label]?'' (looking preference) and then told, {``Put} the [label] in the basket'' (reaching preference). Only the 13-month-olds showed rapid word learning on the looking measure; neither age group showed rapid word learning on the reaching measure. In Experiment 2, the procedure was repeated 24\&\#xa0;h later with 10 participants per age group from Experiment 1. After a further 12 labels per object, both age groups now showed robust evidence of rapid word learning, but again only on the looking measure. This is the earliest looking-based evidence of rapid word learning in infants in a well-controlled (i.e., two-word) procedure; our failure to replicate previous reports of rapid word learning in 13-month-olds with a preferential reaching measure may be due to our use of more rigorous controls for object preferences. The superior performance of the younger infants on the looking measure in Experiment 1 was not straightforwardly predicted by existing theoretical accounts of word learning.},

@article{tincoff:2011,
	Abstract = {Comprehending spoken words requires a lexicon of sound patterns and knowledge of their referents in the world. Tincoff and Jusczyk (1999) demonstrated that 6-month-olds link the sound patterns {``Mommy''} and {``Daddy''} to video images of their parents, but not to other adults. This finding suggests that comprehension emerges at this young age and might take the form of very specific word-world links, as in {``Mommy''} referring only to the infant's mother and {``Daddy''} referring only to the infant's father. The current study was designed to investigate if 6-month-olds also show evidence of comprehending words that can refer to categories of objects. The results show that 6-month-olds link the sound patterns ``hand'' and ``feet'' to videos of an adult's hand and feet. This finding suggests that very early comprehension has a capacity beyond specific, one-to-one, associations. Future research will need to consider how developing categorization abilities, social experiences, and parent word use influence the beginnings of word comprehension.},

@article{friedrich:2011_word_,
	Abstract = {There has been general consensus that initial word learning during early infancy is a slow and time-consuming process that requires very frequent exposure, whereas later in development, infants are able to quickly learn a novel word for a novel meaning. From the perspective of memory maturation, this shift in behavioral development might represent a shift from slow procedural to fast declarative memory formation. Alternatively, it might be caused by the maturation of specific brain structures within the declarative memory system that may support lexical mapping from the very first. Here, we used the neurophysiological method of {ERPs} to watch the brain activity of 6-month-old infants, when repeatedly presented with object--word pairs in a cross-modal learning paradigm. We report first evidence that infants as young as 6 months are able to associate objects and words after only very few exposures. A memory test 1 day later showed that infants did not fully forget this newly acquired knowledge, although the {ERP} effects indicated it to be less stable than immediately after encoding. The combined results suggest that already at 6 months the encoding process of word learning is based on fast declarative memory formation, but limitations in the consolidation of declarative memory diminish the long lasting effect in lexical-semantic memory at that age.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies of infants' comprehension of words estimated the onset of this ability at 9 months or later. However, these estimates were based on responses to names of relatively immobile, familiar objects. Comprehension of names referring to salient, animated figures (e.g., one's parents) may begin even earlier. In a test of this possibility, 6-month-olds were shown side-by-side videos of their parents while listening to the words "mommy" and "daddy." The infants looked significantly more at the video of the named parent. A second experiment revealed that infants do not associate these words with men and women in general. Infants shown videos of unfamiliar parents did not adjust their looking patterns in response to "mommy" and "daddy."},

A number of recent studies suggest that from very early in ontogeny young children have a biological predisposition to help others achieve their goals, to share resources with others and to inform others of things helpfully. Humans' nearest primate relatives, such as chimpanzees, engage in some but not all of these behaviors: they help others instrumentally, but they are not so inclined to share resources altruistically and they do not inform others of things helpfully. The evolutionary roots of human altruism thus appear to be much more complex than previously supposed.},

@article{ferguson_listeners_2012,
	Abstract = {During everyday social interactions, we typically anticipate (or explain) others' behaviour according to their current mental states (e.g. their knowledge, beliefs and intentions). To date, very little is known about the time-course with which such perspective information influences communication. We report a novel interactive `visual world' study examining these processes. Here, two communicators watched videos depicting transfer events and subsequently described these events to each other. Critically, on half the trials a screen blocked the speakers' (but not the listeners') view part-way through the video, establishing a discrepancy in the knowledge held by the two communicators. Eye-tracking analyses showed that listeners were rapidly sensitive to their partner's perspective, as evidenced by a significantly reduced reality-bias when speakers held out-of-date knowledge about a privileged transfer event. However, we also found that under these conditions, listeners suffered ongoing interference from their own knowledge of reality, which inhibited successful anticipation of the speaker's intended referents.},

We directly tested the hypothesis that such individuals nevertheless fail to mentalize spontaneously. To this end, we used an eye-tracking task that has revealed the spontaneous ability to mentalize in typically developing infants. We showed that, like infants, neurotypical adults' (n = 17 participants) eye movements anticipated an actor's behavior on the basis of her false belief. This was not the case for individuals with Asperger syndrome (n = 19). Thus, these individuals do not attribute mental states spontaneously, but they may be able to do so in explicit tasks through compensatory learning.},

@article{cavallo_grasping_2011,
	Abstract = {Although facilitation of the corticospinal system during action observation is widely accepted, it remains controversial whether this facilitation reflects a replica of the observed movements or the goal of the observed motor acts. In the present study, we asked whether, when an object is grasped by using a tool, corticospinal facilitation represents 1) the movements of the hand, 2) the movements of the tool, or 3) the distal goal of the action. To address this question, we recorded motor-evoked potentials {(MEPs)} to transcranial magnetic stimulation while participants observed a hand reaching and grasping a mothball by using 3 types of pliers, requiring different hand--tool movements to achieve the same goal (grasping the object). We found that {MEPs} recorded from the opponens pollicis and from the first dorsal interosseous reflected the observed hand movements rather than the movements of the tool or the distal goal of the action. These results suggest that during observation of tool actions, detailed motor matching recruits online the same muscles as those used in the observed action.},

@article{borroni_mirroring_2011,
	Abstract = {Observation of others' actions induces a subliminal activation of motor pathways (motor resonance) that is mediated by the mirror neuron system and reflects the motor program encoding the observed action. Whether motor resonance represents the movements composing an action or also its motor intention remains of debate, as natural actions implicitly contain their motor intentions. Here, action and intention are dissociated using a natural and an impossible action with the same grasping intention: subjects observe an avatar grasping a ball using either a natural hand action (`palmar' finger flexion) or an impossible hand action (`dorsal' finger flexion). Motor-evoked potentials {(MEPs)}, elicited by single transcranial magnetic stimulation of the hand area in the primary motor cortex, were used to measure the excitability modulation of motor pathways during observation of the two different hand actions. {MEPs} were recorded from the opponens pollicis {(OP)}, abductor digiti minimi {(ADM)} and extensor carpi radialis {(ECR)} muscles. A significant {MEP} facilitation was found in the {OP}, during observation of the grasping phase of the natural action; {MEPs} in the {ADM} were facilitated during observation of the hand opening phase of the natural action and of both opening and grasping phases of the impossible action. {MEPs} in the {ECR} were not affected. As different resonant responses are elicited by the observation of the two different actions, despite their identical intention, we conclude that the mirror neuron system cannot utilize the observer's subliminal motor program in the primary motor cortex to encode action intentions.},

@book{rizzolatti_mirrors_2008,
	Abstract = {Emotions and actions are powerfully contagious; when we see someone laugh, cry, show disgust, or experience pain, in some sense, we share that emotion. When we see someone in distress, we share that distress. When we see a great actor, musician or sportsperson perform at the peak of their abilities, it can feel like we are experiencing just something of what they are experiencing. Yet only recently, with the discover of mirror neurons, has it become clear just how this powerful sharing of experience is realised within the human brain. This book provides, for the first time, a systematic overview of mirror neurons, written by the man who first discovered them.  In the early 1990's Giacomo Rizzolatti and his co-workers at the University of Parma discovered that some neurons had a surprising property. They responded not only when a subject performed a given action, but also when the subject observed someone else performing that same action. These results had a deep impact on cognitive neuroscience, leading the neuroscientist vs Ramachandran to predict that 'mirror neurons would do for psychology what {DNA} did for biology'. The unexpected properties of these neurons have not only attracted the attention of neuroscientists. Many sociologists, anthropologists, and even artists have been fascinated by mirror neurons. The director and playwright Peter Brook stated that mirror neurons throw new light on the mysterious link that is created each time actors take the stage and face their audience - the sight of a great actor performing activates in the brain of the observer the very same areas that are active in the performer - including both their actions and their emotions. Written in a highly accessible style, that conveys something of the excitement of this groundbreaking theory, Mirrors in the Brain is the definitive account of one the major scientific discoveries of the past 50 years.},

	Abstract = {Three studies were carried out to investigate sentential complements being the critical device that allows for false-belief understanding in 3- and 4-year-olds {(N} = 102). Participants across studies accurately gazed in anticipation of a character's mistaken belief in a predictive looking task despite erring on verbal responses for direct false-belief questions. Gaze was independent of complement mastery. These patterns held when other low-verbal false-belief tasks were considered and the predictive looking task was presented as a time-controlled film. While implicit (gaze) knowledge predicted explicit (verbal) false-belief understanding, complement mastery and cognitive flexibility also supported explicit reasoning. Overall, explicit false-belief understanding is complexly underpinned by implicit knowledge and input from higher-order systems of language and executive control.},

	Abstract = {The false belief task commonly used in the study of theory of mind {(ToM)} requires participants to select among competing responses and inhibit prepotent responses, giving rise to three possibilities: (1) the false belief tasks might require only executive function abilities and there may be no domain-specific component; (2) executive control might be necessary for the emergence of {ToM} in development but play no role in adult mental state inferences; and (3) executive control and domain-specific {ToM} abilities might both be implicated. We used {fMRI} in healthy adults to dissociate these possibilities. We found that non-overlapping brain regions were implicated selectively in response selection and belief attribution, that belief attribution tasks recruit brain regions associated with response selection as much as well-matched control tasks, and that regions associated with {ToM} (e.g., the right temporo-parietal junction) were implicated only in the belief attribution tasks. These results suggest that both domain-general and domain-specific cognitive resources are involved in adult {ToM.}},

We challenge the `bootstrapping' theory which claims that children move from using something like an object-file -- an attentional process for responding to small numerosities -- to a truly arithmetic one as a result of their learning the counting words. We also question the interpretation of recent findings from Amazonian cultures that have very restricted number vocabularies. Our review of data and theory, along with neuroscientific evidence, imply that numerical concepts have an ontogenetic origin and a neural basis that are independent of language.},

	Abstract = {Data on numerical processing by verbal (human) and non-verbal (animal and human) subjects are integrated by the hypothesis that a non-verbal counting process represents discrete (countable) quantities by means of magnitudes with scalar variability. These appear to be identical to the magnitudes that represent continuous (uncountable) quantities such as duration. The magnitudes representing countable quantity are generated by a discrete incrementing process, which defines next magnitudes and yields a discrete ordering. In the case of continuous quantities, the continuous accumulation process does not define next magnitudes, so the ordering is also continuous (`dense'). The magnitudes representing both countable and uncountable quantity are arithmetically combined in, for example, the computation of the income to be expected from a foraging patch. Thus, on the hypothesis presented here, the primitive machinery for arithmetic processing works with real numbers (magnitudes).},

@article{feigenson_limits_2005,
	Abstract = {Recent work suggests that infants rely on mechanisms of object-based attention and short-term memory to represent small numbers of objects. Such work shows that infants discriminate arrays containing 1, 2, or 3 objects, but fail with arrays greater than 3 {[Feigenson}, L., \&amp; Carey, S. (2003). Tracking individuals via object-files: Evidence from infants' manual search. Developmental Science, 6, 568--584; Feigenson, L., Carey, S., \&amp; Hauser, M. (2002). The representations underlying infants' choice of more: Object files versus analog magnitudes. Psychological Science, 13(2), 150--156]. However, little is known about how infants represent arrays exceeding the 3-item limit of parallel representation. We explored possible formats by which infants might represent a 4-object array. Experiment 1 used a manual search paradigm to show that infants successfully discriminated between arrays of 1 vs. 2, 2 vs. 3, and 1 vs. 3 objects. However, infants failed to discriminate 1 vs. 4 despite the highly discriminable ratio, providing the strongest evidence to date for object-file representations underlying performance in this task. Experiment 2 replicated this dramatic failure to discriminate 1 from 4 in a second paradigm, a cracker choice task. We then showed that infants in the choice task succeeded at choosing the larger quantity with 0 vs. 4 crackers and with 1 small vs. 4 large crackers. These results suggest that while infants failed to represent 4 as ``exactly 4'', ``approximately 4'', ``3'', or as even as ``a plurality'', they did represent information about the array, including the existence of a cracker or cracker-material and the size of the individual objects in the array.},

In this paradigm, patterns of searching revealed the number of objects infants represented as hidden in an opaque box. In Experiment 1, we obtained the set-size signature of object-file representations: infants succeeded at representing precisely 1, precisely 2, and precisely 3 objects in the box, but failed at representing 4 (or even that 4 is greater than 2). In Experiment 2, we showed that infants' expectations about the contents of the box were based on number of individual objects, and not on a continuous property such as total object volume. These findings support the hypothesis that infants maintained representations of individuals, that object-files were the underlying means of representing these individuals, and that object-file models can be compared via one-to-one correspondence to establish numerical equivalence.},

	Abstract = {3-6-year-old children were either put into real-life situations or were read stories in which another person or story character was excluded from certain information. Their competence in attributing absence of knowledge (ignorance) was compared to their competence in attributing a false belief to the other. A marked difference between attributions was found. In a transitional stage at 3-4 years children were able to attribute ignorance but failed to attribute the resulting false belief. The same developmental gap for children about 2 years older was found between the attribution of second-order ignorance and second-order false belief. Results are interpreted to show that children at a transitional stage find it difficult to represent the incompatible propositions describing the true state of affairs and the state of affairs falsely believed to be true by the other. Such a complexity is not involved in the understanding of ignorance where it has just to be represented that the other does not share the representation of the true state of affairs.},

@article{ernest-jones_effects_2011,
	Abstract = {Laboratory studies have shown that images of eyes can cause people to behave more cooperatively in some economic games, and in a previous experiment, we found that eye images increased the level of contributions to an honesty box. However, the generality and robustness of the eyes effect is not known. Here, we extended our research on the effects of eye images on cooperative behavior to a novel context---littering behavior in a university cafeteria---and attempted to elucidate the mechanism by which they work, by displaying them both in conjunction with, and not associated with, verbal messages to clear one's litter. We found a halving of the odds of littering in the presence of posters featuring eyes, as compared to posters featuring flowers. This effect was independent of whether the poster exhorted litter clearing or contained an unrelated message, suggesting that the effect of eye images cannot be explained by their drawing attention to verbal instructions. There was some support for the hypothesis that eye images had a larger effect when there were few people in the caf{\'e} than when the caf{\'e} was busy. Our results confirm that the effects of subtle cues of observation on cooperative behavior can be large in certain real-world contexts.},

This paper describes the features of our auditory experience that can lead one to think of sounds in this way. It then describes a way we can experience sounds as being part of the material world. Since this is a kind of experience that essentially involves more than one sense, the paper ends by drawing some conclusions about how we should think about the senses.},

@article{ferguson_eye_2011,
	Abstract = {The time-course of representing others' perspectives is inconclusive across the currently available models of {ToM} processing. We report two visual-world studies investigating how knowledge about a character's basic preferences (e.g. Tom's favourite colour is pink) and higher-order desires (his wish to keep this preference secret) compete to influence online expectations about subsequent behaviour. Participants' eye movements around a visual scene were tracked while they listened to auditory narratives. While clear differences in anticipatory visual biases emerged between conditions in Experiment 1, post-hoc analyses testing the strength of the relevant biases suggested a discrepancy in the time-course of predicting appropriate referents within the different contexts. Specifically, predictions to the target emerged very early when there was no conflict between the character's basic preferences and higher-order desires, but appeared to be relatively delayed when comprehenders were provided with conflicting information about that character's desire to keep a secret. However, a second experiment demonstrated that this apparent `cognitive cost' in inferring behaviour based on higher-order desires was in fact driven by low-level features between the context sentence and visual scene. Taken together, these results suggest that healthy adults are able to make complex higher-order {ToM} inferences without the need to call on costly cognitive processes. Results are discussed relative to previous accounts of {ToM} and language processing.},

@article{surtees_direct_2011,
	Abstract = {Studies with infants show divergence between performance on theory of mind tasks depending on whether direct or indirect measures are used. It has been suggested that direct measures assess a flexible but cognitively demanding ability to reason about the minds of others, whereas indirect measures assess distinct processes which afford more efficient but less flexible theory of mind abilities {(Apperly} \& Butterfill, 2009). This leads to the prediction that performance on indirect measures should be subject to signature limits. The current study tested whether the {Level-1/Level-2} distinction might constitute one such limit. The study adapted a task that has shown evidence of Level-1 perspective-taking on both direct and indirect measures {(Samson}, Apperly, Braithwaite, Andrews, \& {Bodley-Scott}, 2010). The aim was to test Level-2 perspective-taking in a sample of 6- to 11-year-olds {(N=} 80) and adults {(N=} 20). Participants were able to make Level-2 judgements on the direct measure. In contrast with the findings from Level-1 perspective-taking, there was no evidence of automatic processing of Level-2 perspectives on the indirect measure. This finding is consistent with the view that theory of mind abilities assessed by indirect measures are subject to signature limits. The {Level-1/Level-2} distinction, suitably refined, marks one way in which efficient but inflexible theory of mind abilities are limited.},

@book{geurts_quantity_2011,
	Abstract = {In recent years, quantity implicatures - a type of pragmatic inference - have been widely debated in linguistics, philosophy, and psychology, and have been subject to an enormous variety of analyses, ranging from lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic, to various hybrid accounts. In this first book-length discussion of the topic, Bart Geurts presents a theory of quantity implicatures that is resolutely pragmatic, arguing that the orthodox Gricean approach to conversational implicature is capable of accounting for all the standard cases of quantity implicature, and more. He shows how the theory deals with free-choice inferences as merely a garden variety of quantity implicatures, and gives an in-depth treatment of so-called 'embedded implicatures'. Moreover, as well as offering a comprehensive theory of quantity implicatures, he also takes into account experimental data and processing issues. Original and pioneering, and avoiding technical terminology, this insightful study will be invaluable to linguists, philosophers, and experimental psychologists alike.},

@article{clifford_color_2010,
	Abstract = {Categorical perception {(CP)} of color is the faster and/or more accurate discrimination of colors from different categories than equivalently spaced colors from the same category. Here, we investigate whether color {CP} at early stages of chromatic processing is independent of top-down modulation from attention. A visual oddball task was employed where frequent and infrequent colored stimuli were either same- or different-category, with chromatic differences equated across conditions. Stimuli were presented peripheral to a central distractor task to elicit an event-related potential {(ERP)} known as the visual mismatch negativity {(vMMN).} The {vMMN} is an index of automatic and pre-attentive visual change detection arising from generating loci in visual cortices. The results revealed a greater {vMMN} for different-category than same-category change detection when stimuli appeared in the lower visual field, and an absence of attention-related {ERP} components. The findings provide the first clear evidence for an automatic and pre-attentive categorical code for color.},

@article{kovacs_social_2010,
	Abstract = {Human social interactions crucially depend on the ability to represent other agents' beliefs even when these contradict our own beliefs, leading to the potentially complex problem of simultaneously holding two conflicting representations in mind. Here, we show that adults and 7-month-olds automatically encode others' beliefs, and that, surprisingly, others' beliefs have similar effects as the participants' own beliefs. In a visual object detection task, participants' beliefs and the beliefs of an agent (whose beliefs were irrelevant to performing the task) both modulated adults' reaction times and infants' looking times. Moreover, the agent's beliefs influenced participants' behavior even after the agent had left the scene, suggesting that participants computed the agent's beliefs online and sustained them, possibly for future predictions about the agent's behavior. Hence, the mere presence of an agent automatically triggers powerful processes of belief computation that may be part of a ``social sense'' crucial to human societies.},

@article{brooks_intelligence_1991,
	Abstract = {Artificial intelligence research has foundered on the issue of representation. When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporate--everything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments.},

@article{gerhardstein_p._roles_1999,
	Abstract = {For both adults and infants, whether a unique target pops out from a background of distractors and captures attention depends on the perceived target-distractor similarity. For adults, this similarity can be categorical as well as perceptual, but whether the same is true for infants is unknown. Here, the authors examined whether infants' colour pop-out is affected by categorical target-distractor similarity using targetdistractor pairs in Munsell colours from either the same or a different category and representing different degrees of perceptual similarity. It was found that only targets that were perceptually most dissimilar from the distractor colours popped out, irrespective of category membership; target colours more perceptually similar to the distractor colour did not, even if they were from a different colour category. Although young infants are known to categorize colours in an adult-like fashion, whether or not they preattentively detect a uniquely coloured target is determined by a noncategorical, perceptual colour metric.},

@article{runeson_kinematic_1983,
	Abstract = {Presents the principle of kinematic specification of dynamics {(KSD),} which states that movements specify the causal factors of events, in order to challenge the widespread conviction that perceiving another person must rest on ambiguous and falsifiable information. 89 Ss (aged 19-53 yrs), most of whom were undergraduates, participated in 6 experiments. Ss observed actors in action via G. Johansson's (see record 1974-10267-001) patch-light technique and made judgments about the actors' actions and gender. Results show that (a) the influence of an invisible thrown object on the kinematics of the thrower enabled Ss to perceive the length of the throw; (b) the lead-in movements of lifting allowed perception of the weight lifted; (c) an actor lifting a box could not deceive Ss about the weight, but only convey the deception; and (d) gender was recognizable in about 75\% of the presentations, and this percentage rose when the actors were not self-conscious about gender. Results demonstrate the considerable effectiveness of kinematic information in enabling perception of persons and actions. The {KSD} principle therefore appears an appropriate conceptual guide, and the patch-light technique a useful empirical method, for the study of social knowing.

	Abstract = {In everyday life, many people believe that two heads are better than one. Our ability to solve problems together appears to be fundamental to the current dominance and future survival of the human species. But are two heads really better than one? We addressed this question in the context of a collective low-level perceptual decision-making task. For two observers of nearly equal visual sensitivity, two heads were definitely better than one, provided they were given the opportunity to communicate freely, even in the absence of any feedback about decision outcomes. But for observers with very different visual sensitivities, two heads were actually worse than the better one. These seemingly discrepant patterns of group behavior can be explained by a model in which two heads are Bayes optimal under the assumption that individuals accurately communicate their level of confidence on every trial.},

@article{fogassi_mirror_2007,
	Abstract = {Mirror neurons are a class of neurons first discovered in the monkey premotor cortex that activate both when the monkey executes an action and when it observes the same action made by another individual. These neurons enable individuals to understand actions performed by others. Two subcategories of mirror neurons in monkeys activate when they listen to action sounds and when they observe communicative gestures made by others, respectively. The properties of mirror neurons could constitute a substrate from which more sophisticated forms of communication evolved; this would make sense, given the anatomical and functional homology between part of the monkey premotor cortex and Broca's area (the ``speech'' area of the brain) in humans. We hypothesize that several components of human language, including some aspects of phonology and syntax, could be embedded in the organizational properties of the motor system and that a deeper knowledge of this system could shed light on how language evolved.},

@article{wolpert_internal_1998,
	Abstract = {This review will focus on the possibility that the cerebellum contains an internal model or models of the motor apparatus. Inverse internal models can provide the neural command necessary to achieve some desired trajectory. First, we review the necessity of such a model and the evidence, based on the ocular following response, that inverse models are found within the cerebellar circuitry. Forward internal models predict the consequences of actions and can be used to overcome time delays associated with feedback control. Secondly, we review the evidence that the cerebellum generates predictions using such a forward model. Finally, we review a computational model that includes multiple paired forward and inverse models and show how such an arrangement can be advantageous for motor learning and control.},

@article{wiltermuth_synchrony_2009,
	Abstract = {Armies, churches, organizations, and communities often engage in activities---for example, marching, singing, and dancing---that lead group members to act in synchrony with each other. Anthropologists and sociologists have speculated that rituals involving synchronous activity may produce positive emotions that weaken the psychological boundaries between the self and the group. This article explores whether synchronous activity may serve as a partial solution to the free-rider problem facing groups that need to motivate their members to contribute toward the collective good. Across three experiments, people acting in synchrony with others cooperated more in subsequent group economic exercises, even in situations requiring personal sacrifice. Our results also showed that positive emotions need not be generated for synchrony to foster cooperation. In total, the results suggest that acting in synchrony with others can increase cooperation by strengthening social attachment among group members.},

@article{pietroski_actions_1998,
	Abstract = {The event analysis of action sentences seems to be at odds with plausible {(Davidsonian)} views about how to count actions. If Booth pulled a certain trigger, and thereby shot Lincoln, there is good reason for identifying Booth's action of pulling the trigger with his action of shooting Lincoln; but given truth conditions of certain sentences involving adjuncts, the event analysis requires that the pulling and the shooting be distinct events. So I propose that event sortals like "shooting" and "pulling" are true of complex events that have actions (and various effects of actions) as parts. Combining this view with some facts about so-called causative verbs, I then argue that paradigmatic actions are best viewed as tryings, where tryings are taken to be intentionally characterized events that typically cause peripheral bodily motions. The proposal turns on a certain conception of what it is to be the Agent of an event; and I conclude by elaborating this conception in the context of some recent discussions about the relation of thematic roles to grammatical categories.},

Some ability of this genre appears to exist by 2-3 years of age, at least. The data suggest a distinction between an earlier {(Level} 1) and a later {(Level} 2) developmental form of visual percept inference. At Level 1, S is capable of nonegocentrically inferring that O sees an object presently nonvisible to S himself. At Level 2, S is also capable of nonegocentrically inferring how an object that both currently see appears to O, that is, how it looks from his particular spatial perspective.},

	Abstract = {Findings from studies of visual memory and change detection have revealed a surprising inability to detect large changes to scenes from one view to the next ('change blindness'). When some form of disruption is introduced between an original and modified display, observers often fail to notice the change. This disruption can take many forms (eg an eye movement, a flashed blank screen, a blink, a cut in a motion picture, etc) with similar results. In all cases, the changes are sufficiently large that, were they to occur instantaneously, they would consistently be detected. Prior research on change blindness was predicated on the assumption that, in the absence of a visual disruption, the signal caused by the change would draw attention, leading to detection. In two experiments, we demonstrate that change blindness can occur even in the absence of a visual disruption. In one experiment, subjects actually detected more changes with a disruption than without one. When changes are sufficiently gradual, the visible change signal does not seem to draw attention, and large changes can go undetected. The findings are discussed in the context of metacognitive beliefs about change detection and the strategic decisions those beliefs entail.},

	Abstract = {As people examine their world, the proximal stimulus changes position on their retinae with every saccade, but they perceive the world as being stable. This phenomenon of visual stability was explored by making changes in natural, full-color pictures during selected saccades as observers examined them in preparation for a recognition test. In Experiment 1, the pictures were displaced up, down, left, or right by 0.3, 0.4, or 1.2 degrees. In Experiment 2, the pictures were expanded or contracted by 10\% or 20\%. As a secondary task, subjects pressed a button when a change was detected. Three results from previous studies with simpler stimuli did not generalize. Evidence suggests that subjects' detection of image changes primarily involves the use of local information in the region of the eyes' landing position. A saccade target theory of visual stability is proposed.},

Over the past decade this phenomenon has greatly contributed to our understanding of attention, perception, and even consciousness. The surprising extent of change blindness explains its broad appeal, but its counterintuitive nature has also engendered confusions about the kinds of inferences that legitimately follow from it. Here we discuss the legitimate and the erroneous inferences that have been drawn, and offer a set of requirements to help separate them. In doing so, we clarify the genuine contributions of change blindness research to our understanding of visual perception and awareness, and provide a glimpse of some ways in which change blindness might shape future research.},

	Abstract = {An individual has a theory of mind if he imputes mental states to himself and others. A system of inferences of this kind is properly viewed as a theory because such states are not directly observable, and the system can be used to make predictions about the behavior of others. As to the mental states the chimpanzee may infer, consider those inferred by our own species, for example, purpose or intention, as well as knowledge, belief, thinking, doubt, guessing, pretending, liking, and so forth. To determine whether or not the chimpanzee infers states of this kind, we showed an adult chimpanzee a series of videotaped scenes of a human actor struggling with a variety of problems. Some problems were simple, involving inaccessible food -- bananas vertically or horizontally out of reach, behind a box, and so forth -- as in the original Kohler problems; others were more complex, involving an actor unable to extricate himself from a locked cage, shivering because of a malfunctioning heater, or unable to play a phonograph because it was unplugged. With each videotape the chimpanzee was given several photographs, one a solution to the problem, such as a stick for the inaccessible bananas, a key for the locked up actor, a lit wick for the malfunctioning heater. The chimpanzee's consistent choice of the correct photographs can be understood by assuming that the animal recognized the videotape as representing a problem, understood the actor's purpose, and chose alternatives compatible with that purpose.},

This article distills properties shared by many of these distinctions and characterizes the resulting systems in light of recent findings and theoretical developments. One system is associative because its computations reflect similarity structure and relations of temporal contiguity. The other is "rule based" because it operates on symbolic structures that have logical content and variables and because its computations have the properties that are normally assigned to rules. The systems serve complementary functions and can simultaneously generate different solutions to a reasoning problem. The rule-based system can suppress the associative system but not completely inhibit it. The article reviews evidence in favor of the distinction and its characterization.},

This article critically examines the scientific advance offered by these theories (in particular advances in the domains of reasoning, decision making, and social cognition) and questions their theoretical coherence as well as the evidence for their existence. We scrutinize the conceptual underpinnings of two-system models and explicate the assumptions underlying these models to see whether they are reasonable. We also evaluate the empirical paradigms used to validate two-system models and ponder about their explanatory strength and predictive power. Given the popularity of these models, we discuss the appeal of two-system theories and suggest potential reasons for their prevalence. We comment on the potential costs associated with these models and allude to the desired nature of potential alternatives. We conclude that two-system models currently provide little scientific advance, and we encourage researchers to adopt more rigorous conceptual definitions and employ more stringent criteria for testing the empirical evidence in support for two-system theories.},

This paper reviews the cognitive perspective's common coding/mirror neuron theory of joint action, describes some of its limitations and then presents the behavioral dynamics perspective as an alternative way of understanding social motor coordination. In particular, behavioral dynamics' ability to explain the temporal coordination of interacting individuals is detailed. Two experiments are then described that demonstrate how dynamical processes of synchronization are apparent in the coordination underlying everyday joint actions such as martial art exercises, hand-clapping games, and conversations. The import of this evidence is that emergent dynamic patterns such as synchronization are the behavioral order that any neural substrate supporting joint action (e.g., mirror systems) would have to sustain.},

Two analyses requiring shared personal goals are rejected, since they fail to explain how people walking together have obligations and rights to appropriate behavior, and corresponding rights of rebuke. An alternative account is proposed: those who walk together must constitute the "plural subject" of a goal (roughly, their walking alongside each other).

	Abstract = {The simple action of pressing a switch has many possible interpretations---the actor could be turning on a light, deleting critical files from a computer, or even turning off a life-support system. In each of these cases, the motor parameters of the action are the same but the physical outcome differs. We report evidence of suppressed responses in right inferior parietal and right inferior frontal cortex when participants saw repeated movies showing the same action outcome, but these regions did not distinguish the kinematic parameters by which the action was accomplished. Thus, these brain areas encode the physical outcomes of human actions in the world. These results are compatible with a hierarchical model of human action understanding in which a cascade of specialized processes from occipital to parietal and frontal regions allow humans to understand the physical consequences of actions in the world and the intentions underlying those actions.},

	Abstract = {The current study investigated the perception of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and tool-based grasping possibilities. In Experiment 1, participants judged whether they would grasp planks of wood-presented in ascending, descending, and random orders of length-using one hand {(1H),} two hands {(2H),} or with a tool that extended their reach {(TH).} In Experiment 2, participants physically grasped the planks using {1H,} {2H,} or {TH.} In Experiments 3 and 4, the choice of {TH} was replaced with a choice of grasping the planks with another person {(2P).} The results showed that presentation order influenced the participants' behavior differently in the judgment and action experiments. The same behavioral patterns, however, were observed when participants switched between {1H} and {2H,} {2H} and {TH,} and {2H} and {2P} grasping. The point at which participants judged they would switch between the different modes of grasping, as well as the point at which participants physically switched between the grasping modes, occurred at similar action-scaled ratios. The equivalence of perceiving intrapersonal and interpersonal affordances is discussed. {(PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2010 {APA,} all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},
